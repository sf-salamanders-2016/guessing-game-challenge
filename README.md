# Guessing Game

## Release 1

Make all of the driver code in driver_code_release_1.rb evaluate to true. Running

    ruby driver_code_release_1.rb

should result in a bunch of "true"s printing to the screen.

(Right now, it fails when it tries to run -- that's normal, since you haven't written anything yet!)

Tip: This is driver code, not RSpec -- you must solve the tests in order, because each line of driver code depends on the lines above it running correctly.

*Don't forget to commit!*

## Release 2

Convert the tests in driver_code_release_1.rb to RSpec. These files should be saved in a spec/ folder in the guessing_game/ folder.
